<h3>
"Your Name" is a Japanese novel written by Makoto Shinkai, which was later adapted into an anime film. The story follows two teenagers, Taki Tachibana and Mitsuha Miyamizu, who live in different parts of Japan. 
<br><br>
Taki is a high school boy living in Tokyo who dreams of becoming an architect. Mitsuha is a high school girl who lives in the rural town of Itomori and feels trapped in her traditional family's expectations. Despite living separate lives, Taki and Mitsuha begin to experience strange occurrences where they intermittently switch bodies while they sleep.<br><br>

Initially confused and disoriented by their body-swapping experiences, Taki and Mitsuha begin to communicate with each other by leaving notes and messages in their respective diaries and on their smartphones. Through these interactions, they learn about each other's lives, dreams, and struggles.<br><br>

As Taki and Mitsuha navigate each other's lives, they develop a deep connection and understanding of one another. However, their body-swapping experiences become increasingly sporadic and unpredictable, leading to moments of confusion and frustration.

As they try to unravel the mystery behind their inexplicable connection, Taki and Mitsuha discover that they are actually living in different timelines. Mitsuha's town was destroyed three years prior in a comet impact disaster, and she died along with many of its residents. Taki, living in the future, becomes determined to change the past and prevent the tragedy from happening.
<br><br>
Through a series of time-traveling attempts and emotional revelations, Taki and Mitsuha race against time to find each other and alter the course of fate. Ultimately, they are able to meet in person and share a brief but poignant moment together before their timelines diverge once again.<br><br>

Despite the challenges and obstacles they face, Taki and Mitsuha's love transcends time and space, leaving a lasting impact on each other's lives and hearts.<br><br>

"Your Name" explores themes of fate, destiny, love, and connection, weaving together elements of science fiction, romance, and Japanese culture into a captivating and emotional narrative.
